Events in JavaScript

Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so 
your code can react to them.

For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by 
displaying an information box. 

There are many different types of events that can occur.

For example:

1. The user selects, clicks, or hovers the cursor over a certain element.

2. The user chooses a key on the keyboard.

3. The user resizes or closes the browser window.

4. A web page finishes loading.

5. A form is submitted.

6. A video is played, paused, or ends.

7. An error occurs.
