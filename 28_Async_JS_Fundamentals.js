Async Code in JavaScript

Async Function

The async function allows us to write promise-based code as if it were synchronous. 
This ensures that the execution thread is not blocked.

Promise Handling: Async functions always return a promise. If a value is returned that is not a promise, 
JavaScript automatically wraps it in a resolved promise.
